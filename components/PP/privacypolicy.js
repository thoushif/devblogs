        you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is
        protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive
        information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted
        and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking
        for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for
        "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. While we use
        encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also
        protect your information offline. Only employees who need the
        information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
        service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
        computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information
        are kept in a secure environment. <h2>Updates</h2> Our Privacy Policy
        may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this
